    "Deepfakes are computer generated videos of people that give the illusion of authenticity. The most common deepfake replaces a victims face with someone elses face. Deepfakes can be benign, such as switching celebrity faces for entertainment, and in cinema, particularly for ageing affects. However, since the majority of deepfakes don't disclose that it's real, it can have negative effects on the future of society. Video evidence can no longer be considered genuine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience for our deepfake detection application is lawyers. Rather than relying on one deepfake detection output, our application returns multiple outputs. In the courtroom, the critical eye of a lawyer can make his/her case for ambiguous videos. Lawyers can interpret the models outputs as they see fit."

    "Since the main source of data for this project is [Meta's Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge) videos, there isn't a lot of meta-data to explore. The provided sample set (training videos + testing videos = 4GB) is 800 videos of paid actors doing regular activities. The quality of deepfakes range from choppy/blurry to very smooth/realistic. It is important to note that although the dataset had instances of auditory deepfakes, this project focused only on the classification of visual deepfakes."

In the case that there is more than one person in a video, helper functions detect unique faces and choose one unique face, the one of higher quality, to remain consistant in output score. Model weights were saved onto file. Outputs ranged from 0.01-0.99, whereby higher scores indicate greater confidence the video is a deepfake. Transfer learned ResNeXt model.  \n",

If the model returns a score greater than 0 on at least one image, we can assume there are glasses. Our backend function only runs a glasses prediction on the uncropped image.

    "Unlike many other machine learning classification problems, deepfakes have tremendous variance since there are many methods for deepfake generation. This project would've benefited from analyzing more deepfake video datasets to better represent the potential variety.  \n",

    "The main user trust feature was eye blinking. It was originally a key-indicator for deepfake detection earlier in the 21st century, but has since become less reliable as deepfakes have become more sophisticated. Eye blink detection is still useful, but may require more analysis on the ratio of open eye frames to closed eyes frames or rate of blinking throughout the video for higher confidence in deepfake detection. Meta's Kaggle dataset didn't seem to have many deepfakes that were incapable of blinking making it a little more challenging to effectively utilize our eye blink model.  \n",

    "The reason deepfakes have received greater attention over recent years is because it's become increasingly easier to create deepfake videos. Mobile apps can create deepfake face swap videos, albeit amateurish quality, quickly with only 1 target image. As deepfakes become more sophisticated, advancements in machine learning research for deepfake detection will also have to keep up."
